## Black hole Investigations of Forbidden line Radiation in Optical Spectra STacks

This code aims to bridge the gap between stellar mass black holes and supermassive
black holes, just as the burning rainbow bridge it is named after bridges the gap
between Asgard and Midgard, by providing a means of searching for them via a
spectral stacking framework.

## Installation
After cloning the repository, you can install locally via pip: ` pip install . `
<br>Or alternatively, ` python setup.py install `

*Note: It may be necessary to increase the open file limit with* ` ulimit -n XXXX `, *depending
on how many spectra you are stacking at once.*
