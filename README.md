<h2>Black hole Investigations For energetic Radiation On Spectra via STacking</h2>

This code aims to bridge the gap between stellar mass black holes and supermassive
black holes, just as the burning rainbow bridge it is named after bridges the gap
between Asgard and Midgard, by providing a means of searching for them via a
spectral stacking framework.
